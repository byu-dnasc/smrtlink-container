GitHub Copilot: To set the `nofile` and `nproc` soft limits for the `smrtanalysis` user, you can use the `ulimit` command in the Dockerfile. However, Docker doesn't support changing these limits directly in the Dockerfile. You need to set these limits when you run the container with the `--ulimit` option.

Here's an example of how to run the container with these limits:

```bash
docker run --ulimit nofile=8192:8192 --ulimit nproc=8192:8192 <image-name>
```

This sets both the soft (`nofile=8192`) and hard (`nproc=8192`) limits for the number of open files and the number of processes.

If you need to set these limits inside the Dockerfile, you might need to use a script that sets these limits and then starts the service. However, this might not work as expected because these are system-level settings that might not be fully respected inside a Docker container.

Remember to replace `<image-name>` with the name of your Docker image.
